      " This code snippet contains several helper functions that can be used for various purposes in JavaScript development. Here's a brief description of each function:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `debounce` and `throttle`: These are higher-order functions used to control the rate at which a function is executed. The difference between them is that `debounce` delays the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last call, while `throttle` limits the number of times a function can be called within a given time frame.\n",
      "2. `formatDate`: This function formats a JavaScript Date object into a specified string format using placeholders like 'mm' for month, 'dd' for day, etc.\n",
      "3. `getTimestamp`: This function returns the current timestamp in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.\n",
      "4. `generateUUID`: This function generates a unique Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) as a string.\n",
      "5. `isValidEmail`, `isValidUrl`, and `isValidPhoneNumber`: These functions validate whether a given value is a valid email address, URL, or phone number, respectively.\n",
      "6. `toSlug`: This function converts a given string into a slug by replacing spaces with hyphens, making the first character lowercase, and truncating it to 200 characters if necessary.\n",
      "7. `truncateAtWhitespace`: This function truncates a given string at the first whitespace character that appears after a specified length.\n",
      "8. `formatNumberWithCommas`: This function formats a number as a string with commas as thousands separators.\n",
      "9. Various utility functions like `truncateString`, `capitalizeFirstLetter`, and `delay` are also included for common use cases. \n",

      "1. `base`: This stage sets up the base environment, installing necessary packages and tools like Miniconda, CMake, and conda-build. It also sets up the buildx tool for multi-arch builds.\n",
      "2. `submodule-update`: This stage is based on the previous one (dev-base) and updates the PyTorch submodules using git submodule update command.\n",
      "3. `build`: This stage is based on the conda image and performs the actual build of PyTorch from source using CMake. It also installs required packages like numpy, ipython, and pyyaml.\n",
      "4. `conda-installs`: This stage is based on the conda image and installs PyTorch and its dependencies using conda. It also sets up the environment variables for building PyTorch from source.\n",
      "5. `official`: This stage is based on a base image (not shown in this Dockerfile) and installs necessary packages like ca-certificates, libjpeg-dev, and libpng-dev using apt-get. It also sets up the environment variables for running PyTorch models with NVIDIA GPUs.\n",
      "6. `dev`: This stage is based on the official image and performs additional setup tasks like installing gcc (for building Triton) and setting up the NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit. It also sets up the environment variables for running PyTorch models using Triton inference server.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dockerfile supports multiple architectures (arm64, x86\\_64) and different versions of PyTorch, CUDA, and Triton. The `ARG` directives at the beginning of the file allow passing these variables to the build process. The `LABEL` directive sets metadata for the image, including the required NVIDIA volumes for the NVIDIA driver. \n",
