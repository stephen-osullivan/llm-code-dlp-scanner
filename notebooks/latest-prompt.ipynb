      "\t* String manipulation: camelCase, kebab case, truncation, and slug generation.\n",
      "\t* Date and time: formatting, timestamp generation.\n",
      "\t* Validation: email, URL, phone number, and number checks.\n",
      "\t* Math: finding maximum/minimum values, counting occurrences, and removing duplicates.\n",
      "3. **Security**: Upon reviewing the code, I didn't find any obvious security vulnerabilities or leaks of confidential information. The functions seem to be designed for general-purpose utility and don't appear to handle sensitive data.\n",
      "4. **Best practices**: The code follows some best practices:\n",
      "\t* Consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variable names).\n",
      "\t* Use of regular expressions for pattern matching.\n",
      "\t* Error handling is minimal, but the code doesn't seem to intentionally hide or manipulate errors.\n",
